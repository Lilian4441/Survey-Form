# survey-form
<h3>A fully functional and interactive survey form</h3>
<h4>Completed: November 2023</h4>

This personal project allowed me to learn more about the world of web development by creating an interactive survey using HTML and CSS. By juggling different elements and styles, I created a user-friendly experience to encourage users to interact and respond. I focused on ease of use as well as a simple, but classy, design. This enabled me to practice my front-end web development skills, as well as learning more about the integration between HTML and CSS. This project challenged me to think more creatively about elements the user would appreciate, as well as refining my coding abilities.
